# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) - Detailed Notes

---

## üìå Overview

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability and is ideal for backup, archiving, big data analytics, content distribution, and static website hosting.

## üß± Key Concepts

### 1. **Buckets**
- A container for storing objects.
- Globally unique name (DNS-compliant).
- Can have bucket policies, lifecycle rules, versioning, etc.

### 2. **Objects**
- Files stored in S3.
- Consist of data + metadata + unique key.
- Maximum object size: 5 TB.
- Multipart upload for files >100 MB (recommended).

### 3. **Keys**
- Unique identifier for an object in a bucket.
- Acts like a file path.

### 4. **Regions**
- Buckets are created in specific AWS regions.
- Reduce latency and cost, and meet regulatory requirements.

## üìÇ Storage Classes

| Class                     | Use Case                               | Durability | Availability | Retrieval |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| S3 Standard              | Frequent access                        | 11 9s      | 99.99%       | Milliseconds |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering   | Unknown access patterns                | 11 9s      | 99.9%-99.99% | Milliseconds |
| S3 Standard-IA           | Infrequent access                      | 11 9s      | 99.9%        | Milliseconds |
| S3 One Zone-IA           | Infrequent access, single AZ           | 11 9s      | 99.5%        | Milliseconds |
| S3 Glacier Instant       | Archival, immediate retrieval          | 11 9s      | 99.9%        | Milliseconds |
| S3 Glacier Flexible      | Archival, flexible retrieval (mins‚Äìhrs)| 11 9s      | 99.9%        | Minutes to hours |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive  | Long-term archival (12+ months)        | 11 9s      | 99.9%        | Hours |

## üîê Security Features

- **Encryption**
  - **At Rest**: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C
  - **In Transit**: SSL/TLS

- **Access Control**
  - **Bucket Policies**
  - **IAM Policies**
  - **ACLs** (deprecated in many cases)
  - **Access Points** for fine-grained access

- **Block Public Access**
  - Prevent public access to buckets and objects at the account or bucket level.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Object Lifecycle Management

- Define lifecycle rules to transition or expire objects.
- Common transitions:
  - S3 Standard ‚Üí IA ‚Üí Glacier ‚Üí Delete
- Reduces storage cost automatically over time.

---

## üîÑ Versioning

- Maintains multiple versions of an object.
- Helps prevent accidental deletions or overwrites.
- Can be enabled per bucket.
- Works with MFA delete for extra protection.

---

## üì§ Replication

- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
  - Automatically replicates objects to a different region.
  - Useful for DR and compliance.

- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
  - Replicates within the same region.
  - Useful for log aggregation, testing, etc.

- Requires bucket versioning to be enabled.

---

## üßæ Event Notifications

- Trigger actions (e.g., Lambda, SNS, SQS) on object events like:
  - `s3:ObjectCreated:*`
  - `s3:ObjectRemoved:*`
  - `s3:ObjectRestore:*`

---

## üìà Monitoring & Logging

- **S3 Access Logs**: Detailed records of bucket access requests.
- **CloudTrail**: Records API calls made to S3.
- **AWS CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor usage, requests, errors.
- **AWS Config**: Track configuration changes and compliance.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Static Website Hosting

- Host static HTML/CSS/JS websites.
- Enable static website hosting in bucket properties.
- Example: `index.html`, `error.html`.

---

## üìä Performance Best Practices

- Use **multipart upload** for large files.
- Use **Transfer Acceleration** for faster global uploads.
- Choose **appropriate storage classes** for cost optimization.
- Use **prefixing strategies** to optimize performance with high request rates.

---

## üß∞ Tools and SDKs

- **AWS CLI**:
  - `aws s3 ls`, `aws s3 cp`, `aws s3 sync`
- **AWS SDKs**: Python (Boto3), Java, Node.js, etc.
- **AWS Console**: GUI for bucket/object management
- **S3 Access Points & Object Lambda**: Advanced access and processing control

---

## üß™ Common Use Cases

- Backup and restore
- Media hosting and distribution
- Data lake and analytics
- Disaster recovery
- Software delivery
- Web hosting
- IoT data storage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Quotas

| Resource                | Limit              |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Buckets per account    | 100 (can request more) |
| Max object size        | 5 TB               |
| Max PUT upload (single) | 5 GB              |
